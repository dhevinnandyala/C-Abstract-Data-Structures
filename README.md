# C-Abstract-Data-Structures

I'm working on this project as a learning experience, to brush up on what I learned in my data structures course (which was in Java), and more importantly, to get comfortable with programming in the C standard library. I plan to make this library fully implement several data structures including:

- LinkedList
- Node (with 2 neighbors)
- List/ArrayList
- Queue
- Stack
- HashMap
- Priority Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree

At the moment, I have mostly implemented some of these, and only partially implemented others, however, I feel quite confident with all of the concepts required for the rest of the project, the data structures knowledge is fresh in my head, but applying C concepts that I didn't in Java-- i.e. programming without classes and objects and instead with structures, and in a procedural way, is definitely an interesting learning experience, and changes the way I think. And of course, having to think about pointers and memory allocation changes my understanding of how computers work, which has been amazing.

The project definitely needs a lot of work to be completed, along with optimization of speed and memory usage for some functions, as well as work on documentation (Although this library probably won't be used by anyone other than me, I thought it'd be good practice to learn to make documentation)

Currently, I'm spending much of my time on a second project, one I hope will actually be used by many users, a Python Stock Analysis bot, which I don't yet feel comfortable making public on my profile-- but I plan for it to be available on Discord, accepting a ticker as a command and providing the user with basic Fundemental and Technical Analyses, Company Data, Industry data, Twitter and News Sentiment Analysis, and links to similar companies.
